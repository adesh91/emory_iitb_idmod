# Let's build off of this SIR model to code an RSV model:
# 1) All individuals are infectious for several days before becoming symptomatic (ùúº)
# 2) Some infectious individuals become symptomatic, and some do not. 


# Then, we write these as difference equations:
# In these equations,
#   lambda is the force (or rate) of infection per susceptible person. Which is: 
#       - contact rate, alpha = 5, multiplied by 
#       - probability of infection on contact with a (symptomatically) infectious person beta = 0.3 OR an asymptomatically infectious person gamma = 0.1, multiplied by 
#       - the probability that a randomly encountered person is infectious I/N 
#   mu = 0.05 is the birth and death rate, maintaining constant population size 
#   omega = 0.02 is the rate at which immunity is lost 
#   sigma = 0.2 is the recovery rate 
#   phi = 0.2 is the rate of becoming infectious 
#   epsilon = 0.35 is the symptomatic ratio

# Define the model -------------------------------------------------------------

# Please define parameters -- THESE ARE THE MODEL PARAMETERS
parms <- c(alpha = 5,         # alpha = daily contacts
           beta = 0.3,        # beta = probability of infection on contact from symptomatic infectious
           beta1 = 0.3396,       # beta1 = amplitude of seasonal variation for symptomatic infectious
           gamma = 0.1,       # gamma = probability of infection on contact from asymptomatic infectious
           gamma1 = 0.3396,       # gamma1 = amplitude of seasonal variation from asymptomatic infectious
           sigma = 0.2,       # sigma = rate of recovery per day
           mu = 0.01,         # mu =  per capita birth and death rate
           omega = 0.02,      # omega = rate of immune loss per day
           phi = 0.2,         # phi = rate of becoming infectious
